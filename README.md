# Train_Scheduler
This is the train scheduler assignment for Week 6. The goal of this project is to have both pre-loaded and appended train schedules that appear on a page that will show the following: 
-train name
-train destination
-frequency of train
-train's next arrival time as it relates to the current time
-minutes away that train is from the current time

Step 1: Make the primary files needed for project: 
-index.html
-assets folder
--nested in the assets folder are the following folders:
a) css folder for style.css document
b) images folder for any images to be applied as styling for the document
c) javascript folder for the train.js document 

Step 2: Link the local CSS and JS files to the HTML page, as well as the JQuery library and Bootstrap library so that they can be accessed during the project. Later on when styling is being performed for the page, Google font links can be added to the HTML page for use as part of styling the page- in this instance, there would be a link for the HTML page and a specific font name to be used in the CSS page.  

Step 3: Create skeleton HTML page so that the javascript document can be used to dynamically update information displayed on the page.
